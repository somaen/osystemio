This is a fork of the Common-code used in ScummVM/ResidualVM,
specifically this is a fork of how ResidualVM looked on 2014-08-20.

The intention of this fork, is to have a usable I/O system for file access,
that still uses the same functions that ScummVM/ResidualVM uses, thus easing
the creation of tools outside ScummVM/ResidualVM (as there is no need to fire
up the graphics/audio/etc-stuff, just to read files, and use the Common data
structures).

What's removed:
* All the actual SDL-code (so, no way to display graphics)
* Mixer code is not included.
* And possibly a bunch of other stuff.

Currently there is no build system in place, and the endian-handling avoids
using SDL_endian.h, so it is neccessary to define 
POSIX
SCUMM_LITTLE_ENDIAN (or SCUMM_BIG_ENDIAN)
SDL_BACKEND
to be able to compile.

To use, remember to first call:
Common::initOSystem()

When your program finishes, call:
Common::deinitOSystem()

Which is also nice enough to call exit(0) for you.

Anyhow, this is probably not usable for anything other than experimentation with
the ScummVM APIs.
